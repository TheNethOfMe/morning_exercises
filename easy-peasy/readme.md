# Easy Peasy Redux State Management

This is another tutorial from Brad Traversy using his starter code.

This simple project is an example of how Easy Peasy can be used on top of Redux to make state management simpler with a simple todo app (because of course it's a todo app!)

To use this app yourself, make sure you are in the `easy-peasy` directory and run `npm install` to install dependancies and then run `npm start` to start the server.

At a time when I'm trying to move away from Redux in future apps, I'm not sure how useful I'd find Easy Peasy. When I first saw the tutorial, I didn't realize it was just another library to put on top of Redux. I thought it was a stand-alone state management system for React. Putting libraries on top of libraries on top of libraries isn't really a solution that sits well with me. But for larger projects in which Redux is neccessary, it could be a viable option.
