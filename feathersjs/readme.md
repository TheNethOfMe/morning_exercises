# Real-time App with Feathersjs and Socketio

This is a tutorial from Brad Traversy using his starter code.

[You can check out his YouTube tutorial here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y33WCVkLwc)

In this tutorial, Brad had us create an "idea app" in which a live streamer could solicit ideas from an audience. By entering an idea into the field and submitting it, the list to the left of the form would be updated in real-time.

## To Run

To use this for yourself, just go into the feathersjs directory, run `npm install` and just open index.html once the dependancies have finished installing. No server required!

## My Thoughts

This project had me using Socketio for the first time. When I was studying C#/.Net, the group I was in used SignalR to make a trivia app that would update for all users in real time. Socketio seems to be the Nodejs equivelant to that.

The trivia project that we made was functional, but its presentation fell short of what I wanted it to be. Perhaps it would be a fun project to revisit on my own. Of course, I'd be using Node and Socketio rather than .Net and SignalR this time around.

As for Feathersjs, I'm not sure what to make of it yet. Some of the comments to Brad's video seem to indicate that it's the next MeteorJS, and to be honest, I was never quite sure what it was supposed to be for either. But perhaps if Feathersjs is on the rise, it'd be best to investigate that further rather than doing a deeper dive into the MeteorJS docs.
