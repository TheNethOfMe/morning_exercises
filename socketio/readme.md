# Chat App with Socketio

This is a tutorial from Brad Traversy using his starter code.

In this tutorial, we build a chat app that updates accross clients in real time and uses unique ids to keep track of different chat rooms.

## To Run

To use this for yourself, just go into the socketio directory, run `npm install` then run `npm start` and you'll be able to view the application in a web browser at localhost:3000. You could also use `npm run dev` to run in development mode if you want to make your own tweaks to it and have it update.

## My Thoughts

I have not been on top of my documentaion lately so I need to catch up. I'm checking out a few tutorials right now to learn about some technologies to build a game I can play accross computers. I had been following the development of a board game that had really caught my attention. But with COVID locking everything down as I write this, I might be awhile before it's safe to gather with friends in person. Creating a version of this that we can play online would let us play and let us test-drive the game before I buy it. It's a \$90 game, which is a lot of money for me right now.

At this point, I'm thinking of a few things that I'd probably want to use to build the application. Socket.io to make the game update across clients, webpack to make css and js development eaiser, and ejs to allow for easy front-end html development. Of course this also requires the use of express, so this is a lot of things working in concert. I need to learn a little more about how to get all these things to cooperate.
